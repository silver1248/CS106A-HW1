This is cool!

This is a set of exercises in learning java.

To build either use an IDE, or `mvn clean package` followed by `java
-jar ` then the name of the class that you'd like to run.  As it's a
set of exercises, there is no single main class.

----------

Today we found one bug that makes karel turn left twice instead of
once and it probably occured somewhere between goToCeiling and
goToColumn and we have to fix that. Also we kind of made karels little
world. Lastly I learned how to use debuging statements and debug. To
debug we click the bug in the middle of the toolbar and press step
over and work out the kinks. And to use debuging statements we make
the method print something so we know when the method starts and ends.
